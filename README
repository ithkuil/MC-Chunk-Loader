Requires: Apache configuration, PHP with zlib (php5-zlib), WebGL-enabled browser,
save tree in [wwwroot]/world/ , writable world/ tree (chmod -R 777 world) 
NEW REQUIREMENT: writable chunks/ folder!!

http://www.php.net/manual/en/zlib.installation.php

Pre-prototype JavaScript world viewer for Minecraft Alpha files.  
This is not particularly useful at the moment except for people that 
may want a starting point for loading MineCraft files in JavaScript.
The world.js and nbt.js may be explanatory since it is fairly short
(but crappy, I know).

See files for credits of things I copy-pasted from the internet.
Also see github wiki where I started writing a book with all my plans.

Put on a good web server (VPS) with world/ in same folder. 
Might work locally, I haven't tried that.
You will need to put this in the Apache conf (if that is what you are using):

AddEncoding x-gzip .dat

That will make it so the browser decompresses the level files.

Not sure the level data is going through quite intact, probably need to
base64 encode or JSON encode before loading it.

Now using PHP to index chunks (buildindex.php).  May not actually be necessary.
You could also use node.js or anything else to count/index the chunks.

Tested with chromium --enable-webgl . Chrome Beta doesn't perform WebGL well for me. 
Should work in webgl enabled browsers http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_a_WebGL_Implementation .  If it doesn't work check the AddEncoding and apache 
restart, clear cache, get console log.  Not really ready to be released, I think
maybe sometimes it isn't loading and I'm not sure why.

Please consider making this suck less and posting a link somewhere or forking
to a less crappy branch.

Thank you.
